## Part 4: Data Collection and Processing

Now that you've configured a data collection environment (your saved map) and a collection device (your mobile phone or tablet), it's finally time to start creating spatial data with ArcGIS Field Maps!

### Step 1: Select a Data Collection Environment in Field Maps

To collect data with ArcGIS Field Maps, begin by selecting the data collection environment you wish to work in. For this workshop, you'll be collecting data with the Field Maps Workshop map you created in ArcGIS Online. Select the Field Maps Workshop map from your saved maps to get started.

### Step 2: Create a Feature

Once you have opened up the Field Maps Workshop map in ArcGIS Field Maps, you can manage the map and begin creating data using the Field Maps interface. Take a moment to peruse the options and tools available to you in ArcGIS Field Maps and consult the infographic below if needed.

Now that you explored ArcGIS Field Maps, it's time to create your first feature in the field. To create a point feature, touch the create feature button at the bottom-right corner of ArcGIS Field Maps. *The example below is taken from the Hesburgh Library at the University of Notre Dame.*

</p>

Then, populate the fields for the new feature and touch the submit button when you are finished.

*Note: The update point button will switch between being red and blue to indicate the strength of your GPS signal based on the accuracy parameters set in the ArcGIS Field Maps settings. Red indicates that signal is less accurate than required based on your defined parameters. The default accuracy is 30ft.*

Congratulations, you have succesfully created your first feature with ArcGIS Field Maps!

### Step 3: Create a Feature with Dropped Pins

The feature creation tool locates features at the position of your mobile device (or paired GPS reciever), but what if you needed to create a feature in a place you cannot easily position yourself, such as in the middle of a lake?

Fortunately, ArcGIS Field Maps also allows you to create features at locations that are out of reach. To do so, find the location you wish to create a feature at (such as one of the lakes on the University of Notre Dame's campus) and touch and hold your finger on the screen at that location. Doing so will create a Dropped Pin in ArcGIS Field Maps which you can transform into a feature by pressing the collect here button.

To practice creating a feature with the dropped pin method, navigate to one of the lakes on Notre Dame's campus. Then, create a dropped pin and collect the pin as a new point feature.

Congratulations! You now know how to collect features anywhere on the map using ArcGIS Field Maps.

### Exercise: Creating Features

**Task: On your own, create at least five additional features for ND_places_points.**

*ND users can also complete this exercise by searching for and working in the ArcGIS Field Maps Workshop Sandbox map, which has layers for creating point, line, and polygon features.*

### Step 4: Return to ArcGIS Online

After you have finished creating features with ArcGIS Field Maps, you will be able to access your newly created data using ArcGIS Online. You can process your data via ArcGIS Online's Map Viewer or, alternatively, by downloading a copy of the feature layer for use in other GIS platforms. 

Take a minute to return to the map you used to create data with ArcGIS Field Maps and examine the changes to your feature layer(s) in the Map Viewer.

Congratulations, you have successfully created spatial data in the field with ArcGIS Field Maps and ArcGIS Online!
