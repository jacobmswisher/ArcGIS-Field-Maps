## Part 1: ArcGIS Field Maps - An Overview

ArcGIS Field Maps is a mobile application that allows users to create spatial data in the field and to process collected data using ESRI's ArcGIS Online platform. ArcGIS Field Maps is used in a variety of industry and scholarly settings and is well-suited to collaborative data collection efforts as multiple users can simultaneously add to the same spatial dataset.

Using ArcGIS Field Maps with the built-in GPS reciever on most mobile phones will allow you to create features that are typically accurate within about 5 meters under open sky, though accuracy diminshes when you are inside buildings or near bridges and trees. If you require greater accuracy for your research project, consider using ArcGIS Field Maps alongside and separate GPS reciever that, when paired with your mobile phone, allows you to create spatial data that is accurate within a radius of 1 meter or less. You can find a list of smartphone compatible GPS recievers for use with ArcGIS Field Maps [here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/field-maps/android/help/high-accuracy-data-collection.htm).
