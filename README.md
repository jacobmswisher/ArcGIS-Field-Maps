# Getting Started with ArcGIS Field Maps

Welcome to the curriculum page for the Getting Started with ArcGIS Collector workshop.

This workshop provides an introduction to ESRI's ArcGIS Field Maps, a mobile application that allows users to create point, line, and polygon features and mark up maps in the field. ArcGIS Field Maps is a powerful tool that allows you to easily create spatial data on the go with your mobile device. In the course of just an hour, this workshop will prepare you to bring ArcGIS Field Maps along on your next research project and create spatial data wherever you go.

Time: 1 hour

**Note: This workshop provides a very brief walkthrough of creating maps and layers in ArcGIS Online. If you would like more comprehensive instruction for ArcGIS Online before diving into ArcGIS Field Maps, consider exploring the curriculum for the [Mapping with ArcGIS Online Workshop](https://github.com/jacobmswisher/ArcGIS-Online).**
