# Getting Started with ArcGIS Field Maps

Welcome to the curriculum page for the Getting Started with ArcGIS Field Maps Workshop.

This workshop provides an introduction to ESRI's ArcGIS Field Maps, a mobile application that allows users to easily create point, line, and polygon features and mark up maps in the field. In the course of just an hour, this workshop will prepare you to bring ArcGIS Field Maps along on your next research project and create spatial data wherever you go.

Time: 1 hour

**Note: This workshop provides a brief walkthrough of creating maps and layers in ArcGIS Online. If you would like more comprehensive instruction for ArcGIS Online before diving into ArcGIS Field Maps, consider exploring the curriculum for the [Mapping with ArcGIS Online Workshop](https://github.com/jacobmswisher/ArcGIS-Online).**
